    President Muhammadu Buhari on Thursday said the sudden drop in
    the price of crude oil has left Nigeria poor,
    leaving it to struggle economically and it people suffering.
    Mr. Buhari however said his administration’s commitment to transparency and accountability
    was serving the country in good stead, despite severe shortage of resources in the country.
    The President spoke Thursday at the State House, Abuja,
    while receiving the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA)
    Executive Director and Under Secretary General of
    the United Nations, Prof Babatunde Osotimehin.
    “It has been a very difficult year for Nigeria. Before we came to office,
    petroleum sold for about $100 per barrel.
    Then it crashed to $37, and now oscillates between $40 and $45 per barrel.
    Suddenly, we’re a poor country, but commitment to transparency and
    accountability is not making people know that there is severe shortage,”
    Special Adviser on Media and Publicity, Femi Adesina, quoted the President as saying.
    Asking UNFPA to bear with Nigeria in whichever area the country
    could not live up to its responsibilities for now,
    President Buhari said exploding population and different cultural
    practices in the country provide fertile ground for research to organizations like UNFPA
